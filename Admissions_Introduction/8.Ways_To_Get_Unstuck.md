There are times that learning to code is **HARD**.

While learning to code can at times feel overwhelming, there are many resources that you have available to you to help you get unstuck when you hit a challenging task.

## Steps to Get Unstuck

As you work through your pre-work, you should follow these steps to help you get unstuck when you encounter a challenging problem.

1. **Try Something!**
    -  This may seem obvious, but the first thing you should do when stuck is to just ***try something***. Even if the answer isn't correct, you may be able to discover the answer through just trying something out!
2. **Read Your Failing Tests**
    -  Every coding problem has tests that will grade your code. When a test isn't passed, there is a lot of information that will help to guide you on how to fix the error in your code.
3. **Review the Videos and Key Points üí°**
    -  The video and key points are directly connected to the code you need to create. Make sure that you watch the videos if you are stuck on a concept. Additionally, the key points at the end of each lesson have useful terminology and code blocks that you can use in your code.
4. **Explore the Documentation üîç**
    -  Every lesson has links to documentation on the topic that you are learning. Coding documentation are libraries of information that software engineers use to determine how to use certain commands/structures in their own programs. These are full of useful examples that will help you solve the problems.
5. **Google It!**
    -  Luckily, you are not the first person that has ever tried to learn to code. As such, Googling the topic is an amazing way to get unstuck! There is a wealth of information online that we highly recommend you take advantage of!
6. **Watch the Solution Videos**
    - Every exercise has a corresponding solution video! When you are stuck, these can be particularly useful in figuring out how to solve this problem. **NOTE**: The main way you are being assessed is by the two projects, which **DO NOT** have solutions, so make sure you are using these to understand the concept rather than simply complete the problem.
